# REHSEK080_FTO2301_GroupC_RehumileSekoto_DWA_10


For this challenge we are required to use the Shoelace component library
in a brand-new JavaScript project and build the original Tally App example  
using only Shoelace components. We are provided with three user stories that 
should be met at a minimum.

### User stories
- 👩‍💻 As a user, I want to press the "+" and the counter should increase by 1
- 👩‍💻 As a user, I want to press the "-" and the counter should decrease by 1
- 👩‍💻 As a user, if my counter is set to 10, I want to press a button where it will reset the counter to 0.
